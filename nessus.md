The two scans you will most likely use are the basic network scan and the advanced scan

Export reports to .nessus file,HTML , pdf or csv

Reports have links to plugins used to discover vulnerabilities, remediation and sometimes exploitation.

Always manually check vulnerability scan results and give screenshot evidence from the manual verification, not nessus.
